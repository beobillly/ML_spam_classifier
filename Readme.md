## ML Spam Classifier

Naive Bayes S.C. coded in python for a Master 2 Machine Learning two weeks homework.

It's provided with tests from Fabien Vigere (Google dev)

use `python3 test4.py` to test it 

or `python3 td4.py` to launch it

you can also download and modify the code if you want, I intentionally let some debug code if you want to see what is happening.

If you look as the code you can see that (almost) all the functions have a _bis, this is the same funtion but tuned by my care.
The function without a _bis are naive and not (yet) tuned functions.
